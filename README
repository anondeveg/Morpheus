# Morpheus

Matrix manipulation header-only library in C++

## Why?

Fun. This library shouldn't be taken seriously, and definitely **do not** use this in any serious project. The performance is **slow as heck** (we are working on that), the code is sloppy, and errors might arise out of nowhere. It isn't battle-tested (and shouldn't be).

This is just a fun project I made to learn more about matrices.

## The name 

Morpheus is a straightforward reference to The Matrix movie. You know the guy—the one who offers Neo the red pill and pulls him out of the simulation.
